This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development Environment

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## Notes

- There are 2 mock users with timeline data coming from JSON files.
- To toggle between the 2 user timelines, click the "next user" link on the right side of the UI.
- The sidebar's "compose new tweet" web form is functional and you can add a new tweet to the user's timeline from there.

## Deployment

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
